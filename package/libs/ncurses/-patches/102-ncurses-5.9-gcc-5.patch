Building ncurses with GCC 5 (or more precisely, with its 'cpp') fails with a
syntax error, caused by earlier preprocessing.

(I'm not entirely sure whether it's a GCC bug or rather caused by a new
feature which breaks further processing with 'awk' and 'sed';  I *think*
at least the 'awk' inline script "AW2" simply isn't prepared for the changed
output of 'cpp' w.r.t. line directives [1].  Anyway, the patch fixes the issue.)
