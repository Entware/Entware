Subject: [PATCH 19/24] eglibc: Help bootstrap cross toolchain

Taken from EGLIBC, r1484 + r1525

        2007-02-20  Jim Blandy  <jimb@codesourcery.com>

                * Makefile (install-headers): Preserve old behavior: depend on
                $(inst_includedir)/gnu/stubs.h only if install-bootstrap-headers
                is set; otherwise, place gnu/stubs.h on the 'install-others' list.

        2007-02-16  Jim Blandy  <jimb@codesourcery.com>

                * Makefile: Amend make install-headers to install everything
                necessary for building a cross-compiler.  Install gnu/stubs.h as
                part of 'install-headers', not 'install-others'.
                If install-bootstrap-headers is 'yes', install a dummy copy of
                gnu/stubs.h, instead of computing the real thing.
                * include/stubs-bootstrap.h: New file.

+/* Placeholder stubs.h file for bootstrapping.

+   When bootstrapping a GCC/EGLIBC pair, GCC requires that the EGLIBC
+   headers be installed, but we can't fully build EGLIBC without that
+   GCC.  So we run the command:
+
+      make install-headers install-bootstrap-headers=yes

+   difficult headers.  The <gnu/stubs.h> header depends, via the
+   EGLIBC subdir 'stubs' make targets, on every .o file in EGLIBC, but
+   an empty stubs.h like this will do fine for GCC.  */
