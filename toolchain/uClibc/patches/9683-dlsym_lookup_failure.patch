It can happen under certain cases that the DSO had refcount 0,
but was already loaded. (NODELETE flag is set, or it is pulled
in via both NEEDED dependency and explicit dlopen()).

In these cases we must not re-add the DSO to the global symbol
scope as it is already there. Or we end up corrupting the linked
list and further dlsym lookups will hang.
